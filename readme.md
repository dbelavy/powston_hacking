## Advanced Trading Strategies

### Time-Based Trading
```python
# Define time periods for optimal trading
sunrise_hour = sunrise.hour + 1
peak_start = 16
peak_end = 21

# Calculate average future buy price (next 2 hours)
avg_future_buy = sum(buy_forecast[0:4]) / len(buy_forecast[0:4])

# Time-of-day based strategy
if sunrise_hour <= current_hour < peak_start:
    t_o_day = 'daytime'
    action = "charge"  # Charge during daytime for peak usage
elif peak_start <= current_hour < peak_end:
    t_o_day = 'peak'
    action = "auto"    # Auto mode during peak for optimal grid balance
else:
    t_o_day = 'nighttime'
    action = "auto"    # Auto mode at night to maintain grid balance
```

### Price Arbitrage Strategy
```python
# Constants for price-based decisions
PRICE_RATIO_THRESHOLD = 1.5  # Minimum ratio for profitable trading
MIN_SOC = 20                 # Minimum battery charge to maintain
HIGH_SOC = 80               # Target for charging before peak

# Negative price opportunity
if buy_price < 0:
    action = 'import'
    decision_reason = "Importing due to negative price"

# Price arbitrage opportunity
elif sell_price > (avg_future_buy * PRICE_RATIO_THRESHOLD) and battery_soc > MIN_SOC:
    action = 'export'
    decision_reason = f"Price arbitrage (Sell: {sell_price}, Avg future buy: {avg_future_buy})"

# Pre-peak charging strategy
elif (CHARGE_HOUR_START <= current_hour < CHARGE_HOUR_END) and battery_soc < HIGH_SOC:
    action = 'import'
    decision_reason = f"Scheduled charging before peak"
```

### Multi-Inverter Trading Strategy
```python
# Get data from primary inverter
house_power = inverters['inverter_params_1839']['house_power']  # positive is consumption
battery_soc = inverters['inverter_params_1839']['battery_soc']
grid_balance = inverters['inverter_params_1839']['grid_power']  # positive is drawing from grid

# Calculate house consumption in kW for curtailment decisions
house_kW = int(abs(house_power) // 1000) + 1

# Advanced solar control based on multiple conditions
if buy_price < 0:
    action = 'curtail100-curtail'  # Full curtailment during negative prices
elif sell_price > 0:
    action = 'export-export'       # Maximum export when profitable
elif battery_soc <= 95:
    action = 'export-export'       # Fill battery when not full
elif battery_soc > 95 and sell_price < 0:
    # Dynamic curtailment based on house consumption
    if house_kW > 9:
        action = 'export-export'   # High consumption needs full power
    else:
        # Curtail to match house consumption
        curtail_level = max(1, min(9, house_kW))
        action = f'curtail{curtail_level}000-curtail'
```

## Basic Code Examples

### Basic Battery Management
```python
# Constants
MIN_SOC = 20
HIGH_SOC = 80
CHARGE_HOUR_START = 13
CHARGE_HOUR_END = 15
PRICE_RATIO_THRESHOLD = 1.5

# Time-based control
if sunrise_hour <= current_hour < peak_start:
    action = "charge"
elif peak_start <= current_hour < peak_end:
    action = "auto"
else:
    action = "auto"

# Price-based decisions
if buy_price < 0:
    action = 'import'
elif sell_price > (avg_future_buy * PRICE_RATIO_THRESHOLD) and battery_soc > MIN_SOC:
    action = 'export'
```

### Solar Inverter Control
```python
# Price-based solar control
if buy_price < 0:
    action = 'curtail100-curtail'
elif sell_price > 0:
    action = 'export-export'
elif battery_soc <= 95:
    action = 'export-export'
else:
    curtail_level = max(1, min(9, house_kW))
    action = f'curtail{curtail_level}000-curtail'
```

## Best Practices
1. Always maintain minimum battery SOC (State of Charge)
2. Consider time-of-use pricing for charge/discharge cycles
3. Optimize for peak/off-peak periods
4. Monitor battery temperature and health
5. Balance between self-consumption and grid export
6. Use forecasting data for predictive control




## Using Reason Strings
The system uses a `reason` string to log decision-making processes and system state. This provides transparency and helps with debugging and monitoring system behavior.

## Best Practices for Reason Strings

1. **Start with System State**
```python
# Begin with core system metrics
reason += f" House: {house_power}W. Battery: {battery_power}W. Grid: {grid_balance}W. Battery: {battery_soc:.1f}%."
```

2. **Log Price Information**
```python
# Include current and forecasted prices
reason += f" Avg Buy price over the next 4 epochs: {avg_future_buy:.1f}c ~"
reason += f" Sell price {sell_price:.1f}c."
```

3. **Document System Suggestions**
```python
# Log what the system suggests before your logic
reason += f" Powston suggested action: ({suggested_action}) and solar: ({suggested_solar})."
```

4. **Record Time Context**
```python
# Include time-based information
reason += f" Current hour: {current_hour}. Time of day: {t_o_day}."
```

5. **Explain Decisions**
```python
# Document why a decision was made
if buy_price < 0:
    decision_reason = f" Electricity is free: {buy_price}c"
    action = 'curtail100-curtail'
    reason += decision_reason
```

6. **Log Final Decisions**
```python
# Always end with the final decision and its rationale
reason += f" {decision_reason}. Decision: action: {action}, solar: {solar}"
```

## Example of Comprehensive Reason String
```python
# Initialize reason string
reason = ""

# System state
reason += f" House: {house_power}W. Battery: {battery_power}W. Grid: {grid_balance}W."
reason += f" Battery: {battery_soc:.1f}%."

# Price information
reason += f" Avg Buy price over the next 4 epochs: {avg_future_buy:.1f}c."
reason += f" Sell price {sell_price:.1f}c."

# System suggestions
reason += f" Powston suggested action: ({suggested_action}) and solar: ({suggested_solar})."

# Time context
reason += f" Current hour: {current_hour}. Time of day: {t_o_day}."

# Decision making process
if buy_price < 0:
    decision_reason = f" Electricity is free: {buy_price}c"
    action = 'curtail100-curtail'
elif battery_soc > 95 and sell_price < 0:
    decision_reason = f" Battery full and negative sell price"
    if house_kW > 9:
        decision_reason += " High house consumption. Solar at max."
        action = 'export-export'
    else:
        curtail_level = max(1, min(9, house_kW))
        action = f'curtail{curtail_level}000-curtail'
        decision_reason += f" Curtail to {curtail_level:.1f}kW"

# Final decision
reason += f" {decision_reason}. Decision: {action} and {solar}."
```
