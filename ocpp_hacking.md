# OCPP Smart Charging Profiles

How to control EV charging via OCPP 1.6J smart charging profiles using Powstonâ€™s MQTT-based interface and OCPP server.

Powston lets you tune your own energy rulesâ€”whether for battery trading, smart appliance scheduling, or EV charging. This explains how to set charging power limits for your EVSE using MQTT to talk to the siteâ€™s OCPP server.

## Overview

We use MQTT to publish updates to the local OCPP server that manages the EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment). These messages define a **Smart Charging Profile** by setting the max charging rate per phase (in Watts).

This gives you programmable control over how and when the EV can chargeâ€”either:

* **7000 W** for full-speed 3-phase charging (or the EVSE's actual limit),
* **100 W** to effectively "pause" charging and stop the car drawing from the house battery during export or discharge periods.

## Why?

We want to prevent the EV from charging off the house battery when we're discharging to the grid, or doing a strategic export. Instead, car charging should only be allowed when weâ€™re in:

* **charge mode** (topping up the house battery), or
* **import mode** (buying cheap grid power).

That way, you don't rob your battery arbitrage profits just to fill up your car.

## Sample Rule Snippet

Add this to your Powston ruleset:

```python
# OCPP hacking
if action in ['auto', 'discharge', 'export']:
    mqtt_topic_ocpp_max_charge = 100
    reason += f' EV limit {mqtt_topic_ocpp_max_charge}W'
else:
    mqtt_topic_ocpp_max_charge = 7000
    reason += f' EV limit {mqtt_topic_ocpp_max_charge}W'
```

This snippet dynamically adjusts the charge rate:

* In **discharge**, **export**, or **auto** (balancing) modes â†’ we limit EV charging to 100W.
* In **import** or **charge** modes â†’ we allow full-speed EV charging at 7000W.

You can fine-tune the thresholds based on your EV charger, house phase setup, or car battery size.

## How It Works

Your site should have:

* A Powston controller with MQTT integration
* A local OCPP 1.6J server connected to your EVSE
* A config to accept smart charging profiles via MQTT

Once configured, this snippet:

* Publishes to the site's OCPP MQTT topic
* Adjusts the Smart Charging Profile with a simple per-phase power limit
* Ensures that car charging aligns with overall site energy strategy

## Tip for Charge Mode

If using `charge` or `import` to allow car charging, leave enough time at those states for the EV to meaningfully top up.

You can do this by:

* Holding `charge` longer when excess solar is available
* Delaying exports briefly to prioritise car charging, if thatâ€™s your intent

This balance is up to your goalsâ€”site credits vs. EV readiness.
