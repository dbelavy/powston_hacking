## How Powston Thinks (Common Themes First)

### Theme 1: “Auto” means **self-consumption with protection**

**Auto mode prioritises running the home from solar and battery**, while actively protecting the battery and positioning it for future value.

In auto mode, Powston may:

* Discharge to serve house load
* Hold the battery instead of charging or exporting
* Temporarily import to protect future self-consumption
* Block export if it would harm later outcomes

Auto is active control, not idle behaviour.

### Theme 2: Powston protects the battery before optimising profit

Before any export or aggressive discharge, Powston checks:

* Minimum SOC for evening and overnight
* Forecasted solar and load
* Whether the battery would need to be bought back later at a worse price

If protection rules apply, Powston stays in auto even when prices look attractive.

---

### Theme 3: Decisions are forecast-driven, not snapshot-driven

Powston does not react to a single price, SOC reading, or inverter screen.

It evaluates:

* Near-term buy and sell forecasts
* How many future export opportunities remain
* Whether today is a strong or weak solar day
* Whether importing now avoids a worse outcome later

---

### Theme 4: Export is selective, not opportunistic

Powston exports when:

* There is genuine surplus beyond future needs
* The sell price clears forecast-based thresholds
* Exporting now will not force a higher-cost buyback later

Positive prices alone are not sufficient.

---

### Theme 5: Manual actions temporarily override logic

Manual charging or discharging:

* Does not train the system
* Does not change thresholds
* Ends as soon as auto resumes

Powston then re-evaluates from first principles.
